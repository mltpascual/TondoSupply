## Idea 1: "Raw Concrete" — Industrial Brutalism meets Street Culture

### Design Movement
Industrial Brutalism fused with Manila street photography aesthetic. Think concrete walls with wheat-pasted posters, raw textures, and the gritty energy of Tondo's streets.

### Core Principles
1. **Raw Authenticity** — Nothing polished, everything intentional. Exposed grid lines, rough textures, visible structure.
2. **Typographic Dominance** — Massive, bold type that commands attention like street graffiti.
3. **Monochrome + Red Punch** — Black, white, concrete gray with aggressive red accents (matching the brand's red logo).
4. **Collision Layout** — Overlapping elements, broken grids, content that feels like it was slapped on a wall.

### Color Philosophy
- **Dominant**: Deep charcoal (#1A1A1A) and raw concrete (#D4D0C8)
- **Accent**: Tondo Red (#C41E1E) — aggressive, urgent, passionate
- **Neutral**: Off-white (#F5F2ED) for breathing room
- **Emotional Intent**: Gritty confidence, street credibility, unapologetic identity

### Layout Paradigm
Full-bleed asymmetric sections. Hero takes 70% of viewport with a diagonal crop. Product sections use a staggered masonry layout with overlapping cards. Navigation is a minimal top bar that transforms into a full-screen overlay on mobile.

### Signature Elements
1. **Concrete texture overlay** — Subtle noise/grain across all backgrounds
2. **Diagonal slashes** — Red diagonal lines as section dividers, echoing street art
3. **Stamp/seal motif** — Circular red stamp elements (inspired by the brand logo)

### Interaction Philosophy
Aggressive hover states — elements shift, scale slightly, and reveal hidden content. Scroll-triggered reveals that feel like peeling back layers of a wall. No smooth fades — sharp, immediate transitions.

### Animation
- Hero text slides in from left with a slight rotation
- Product cards snap into view on scroll (no ease-out, sharp stop)
- Red accent lines draw themselves across sections
- Hover on products: slight parallax tilt effect

### Typography System
- **Display**: "Bebas Neue" (condensed, all-caps, industrial) — for headlines and hero text
- **Body**: "Space Grotesk" (geometric, modern, readable) — for descriptions and UI text
- **Hierarchy**: H1 at 6rem+, H2 at 3rem, body at 1rem with generous line-height

## Idea 2: "Manila Noir" — Dark Luxury Streetwear Editorial

### Design Movement
Dark editorial luxury — the intersection of high-fashion lookbooks and underground street culture magazines. Think Hypebeast meets Vogue Philippines in a dimly lit Manila alley.

### Core Principles
1. **Cinematic Darkness** — Deep blacks and warm shadows create a moody, aspirational atmosphere.
2. **Editorial Pacing** — Content reveals like turning pages of a premium magazine.
3. **Contrast as Currency** — Sharp contrast between dark backgrounds and bright product imagery.
4. **Restrained Elegance** — Minimal UI chrome, maximum visual impact.

### Color Philosophy
- **Dominant**: True black (#0A0A0A) and warm dark (#1C1917)
- **Accent**: Warm gold (#D4A853) — luxury, aspiration, warmth
- **Secondary**: Crimson (#B91C1C) — brand heritage, passion
- **Text**: Warm white (#FAF5F0) — soft, not harsh
- **Emotional Intent**: Aspirational, premium, mysterious, culturally rooted

### Layout Paradigm
Vertical scroll editorial with full-viewport sections. Each section is a "spread" — left side text, right side imagery, alternating. Hero is a full-screen dark image with text emerging from shadow. Products displayed in a horizontal scroll carousel with large, cinematic cards.

### Signature Elements
1. **Film grain overlay** — Subtle animated grain across dark sections for texture
2. **Gold accent lines** — Thin horizontal rules and borders in warm gold
3. **Fade-from-shadow reveals** — Content emerges from darkness as you scroll

### Interaction Philosophy
Slow, deliberate, luxurious. Hover states are subtle glows and gentle lifts. Scroll speed is slightly dampened for a premium feel. Everything feels intentional and curated.

### Animation
- Hero image fades in with a slow Ken Burns zoom effect
- Text fades up from opacity 0 with a 0.8s ease
- Product cards have a subtle warm glow on hover
- Section transitions use a cinematic wipe effect
- Parallax on background images at 0.3x scroll speed

### Typography System
- **Display**: "Playfair Display" (serif, elegant, editorial) — for headlines
- **Body**: "DM Sans" (clean, modern, highly readable) — for all body text
- **Hierarchy**: H1 at 4.5rem with tight letter-spacing, H2 at 2.5rem, body at 1.05rem

## Idea 3: "Tondo Grid" — Neo-Constructivist Urban Identity

### Design Movement
Neo-Constructivism meets Filipino urban culture. Bold geometric shapes, strong primary colors, and propaganda-style layout that celebrates community identity and street culture pride.

### Core Principles
1. **Geometric Boldness** — Hard angles, strong shapes, no soft curves. Every element is a deliberate geometric statement.
2. **Community Voice** — Design that feels like a movement, not a store. Manifesto-style copy, rally-poster energy.
3. **Color Blocking** — Large areas of flat, saturated color creating visual impact.
4. **Structured Chaos** — Rigid grid system with intentional breaks and overlaps.

### Color Philosophy
- **Dominant**: Off-black (#111111) and pure white (#FFFFFF)
- **Primary Block**: Tondo Red (#DC2626) — identity, energy, community
- **Secondary Block**: Electric yellow (#FACC15) — optimism, street energy
- **Neutral**: Cool gray (#6B7280) for supporting text
- **Emotional Intent**: Bold, communal, energetic, proud, revolutionary

### Layout Paradigm
CSS Grid-based modular layout with strict 12-column system. Hero section uses a 60/40 split with a large red color block. Product sections use a bento-grid style with varying card sizes. Footer is a bold manifesto section with large type.

### Signature Elements
1. **Color block overlays** — Large geometric shapes of red and yellow overlapping content
2. **Rotated text elements** — Vertical or angled text labels on section edges
3. **Bold border frames** — Thick black borders around key content areas

### Interaction Philosophy
Snappy and responsive. Hover states use color inversions (black to red, white to yellow). Click states have a satisfying "press" animation. Navigation is bold and always visible.

### Animation
- Hero elements slide in from different directions and lock into grid positions
- Color blocks expand on scroll to fill their sections
- Product cards flip color on hover (instant, no transition)
- Scroll progress shown as a bold red bar across the top
- Text elements have a typewriter-style reveal

### Typography System
- **Display**: "Anton" (bold, condensed, poster-style) — for headlines and statements
- **Body**: "Work Sans" (geometric, clean, versatile) — for descriptions and navigation
- **Hierarchy**: H1 at 5rem bold uppercase, H2 at 2.5rem, body at 1rem with 1.6 line-height
